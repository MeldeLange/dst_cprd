# The Effects of Daylight Saving Time Clock Changes on Mental and Physical Health in England: Evidence from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)

# Abstract
OBJECTIVES To explore the effects of daylight saving time clock changes on mental and physical health events in primary and secondary care in England.

DESIGN Population-based study using linked electronic health records.

SETTING English primary care practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold database, linked to hospital admissions and Accident and Emergency (A&E) data.

PARTICIPANTS 683,809 individuals (road traffic injuries: all ages, cardiovascular disease (CVD): aged ≥40 years, all other conditions: ≥10 years) registered with a participating English GP practice, with a health event for one of our health conditions in their primary or 
secondary care record in the eight weeks surrounding the Spring or Autumn clock changes between 2008 and 2019.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Health events were defined as a diagnosis code (or symptom code and prescription for mental health outcomes in primary care) of anxiety, major acute CVD, depression, eating disorder, road traffic injury, self-harm  or sleep disorder in primary or 
secondary care, or psychiatric condition in A&E. Negative binomial regression models, adjusted for day of the week and region (and Easter weekend in Spring), compared event rates in the week after the clock changes to the control period (four weeks before the changes 
and weeks two-four after). 

RESULTS In the week after the Autumn clock change five health conditions had fewer events, including: anxiety (IRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.98), acute CVD (IRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.999), depression (IRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.97), 
psychiatric conditions (IRR: 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) and sleep disorders (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97). There was little evidence of reductions in eating disorder diagnoses, road traffic injuries or self-harm.  

CONCLUSIONS There was a reduction in rates of CVD, sleep disorders and mental health disorders after the Autumn clock change, but little evidence that the Spring clock change affected health.
